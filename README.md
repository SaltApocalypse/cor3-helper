## Features

- **Theme Support** — Multiple color themes to match your preference, including an "Original" theme matching the game's native UI colors
- **Pop-up Window / Panel Support** — Exports the UI to pop-up window or side panel depending on your preference
- **Refresh System** — Either by using "refresh all" button or by clicking "refresh" for each section, it refreshes related data available on the UI
- **Pinned Timers** — Every timer except "RESTING" timer for mercenaries can be pinned to top of the UI for tracking
- **Auto Job Refresh** — If the "auto-refresh" checkbox next to pinned job timer is enabled, jobs get automatically refreshed when they reach zero. This gives users more jobs per day by triggering them earlier and giving enough time to finish
- **Auto Decrypt Hacking** — Automatically solves decryption hacks when enabled. Just toggle it on and the extension handles the rest
- **Auto ICE Wall Hacking** — Automatically solves ICE Wall hacking minigame. Detects triangle patterns and clicks them in the correct sequence to complete the puzzle
- **Auto Simple Decrypt Hacking** — Automatically solves Simple Decrypt hacking minigame. Clicks the decrypt button and monitors progress until completion
- **Anti-AFK Clicker** — Automatically prevents the anti-AFK screen locker from appearing by simulating a click on the desktop wrapper every 3 minutes. Enabled internally whenever any automation feature starts (Auto Job Solver, Auto Valuable Seller, Auto Daily Hacking, hack solvers, etc.)
- **Auto Daily Hacking** — Fully automated daily ops solver. Opens daily ops tab, starts the task, detects the puzzle type (System Log Integrity or Signal Hack), solves it end-to-end, closes windows, and auto-disables the toggle after completion. Includes retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with automatic window cleanup between retries
- **Auto Job Solver** — Automated market job solver supporting 9 job types: File Decryption, IP Injection, Data Download, Log Deletion, Log Download, Decrypt & Extract, File Elimination, Data Upload, and IP Cleanup. Features a tabbed UI showing HOME, D4RK, SOYUZ, and USOL market jobs with per-type checkboxes, a start/stop button, and a debug console with Jobs and Logs tabs. Jobs are sorted by server priority (furthest first) and job type priority, automatically handle endpoint setting (with hack-through if unreachable), server login (with hack if no active access), type-specific actions, and job completion with reward tracking. Checks server maintenance status before each job and skips jobs on servers currently in maintenance. Includes dynamic loadout management — automatically equips the right hack/decrypt software before each job and retries with loadout swaps on power/software errors
- **Auto Valuable Seller** — Automated valuable file/log scanner and seller. Scans all reachable servers for valuable files and logs, downloads them, and sells to the best market. Automatically equips optimal SEARCH and HACK software for each server type before scanning. Features a debug console with real-time progress logs, a server/download results UI, and a Maintenance tab with per-server checkbox selections and batch "Force selected!" for triggering multiple servers at once (furthest-to-closest order)
- **Auto Dismiss Failed Jobs** — Toggle to automatically dismiss failed and bugged jobs after each solver run, keeping the job queue clean
- **Auto Finish All Jobs** — Background scheduling that automatically starts the Auto Job Solver when new jobs become available after reset. Uses chrome.alarms to schedule runs at job reset times with retry logic. Works even when the popup is closed. Server maintenance–aware: skips jobs on servers currently in maintenance and schedules retries at the earlier of job reset or maintenance end.
- **Market Path-Through** — When market servers (D4RK, SOYUZ, USOL) or USOL mercenary endpoints are unreachable (no-path-to-server), dynamically fetches the live network map, discovers all paths via DFS, filters out maintenance-blocked routes, and walks intermediate servers (set endpoint + hack) before retrying the target. Falls back to alternate paths if one fails mid-way.
- **Daily Ops** — Countdown to your next daily ops task with streak bonus, difficulty, and claim status
- **Market Monitoring** — View Market-1 (HOME), Market-2 (D4RK), Market-3 (SOYUZ), and Market-4 (USOL) stats, job reset timers, items list (with INFO popup for item details), and jobs list (with Category/Server/Reward columns). Each market is collapsible (fold arrow)
- **Expedition Mode Tabs** — The Expeditions section is split into Mercenaries and Personal Drone tabs. Each tab groups its Active Expedition, mode hub, Decisions and Archived Expeditions as collapsible sub-panels (unified layout)
- **Info Panel Toggles** — Show/hide the Daily Ops and Markets information panels from the Automation/QoL toggles section
- **Inventory (standalone section)** — Inventory is its own section after Expeditions, shared across both expedition modes, with the batch-sell toolbar
- **Loadout Viewer** — View and manage your equipped hardware (CPU/GPU/RAM/PSU) and installed software. Game-style card UI with hardware specs, software power ratios, resource supply/demand overview with boot status, CHANGE/INFO buttons for hardware, and sort/search/equip/unequip for software
- **Active Expedition Tracking** — See active expeditions with remaining timer, cost, risk, insurance, and mercenary info
- **Expedition Decisions** — View and respond to pending decisions by clicking them with score calculation
- **Auto Choose Decision** — Auto choose decisions 1-min before deadline according to their scoring. Configure loot/risk modifiers to change how scoring works.
- **Inventory Viewer** — Browse your stash sorted by rarity (rarest first) then price, with item/storage details, total value, and last-updated timestamps
- **Mercenaries (Multi-Market)** — View mercenaries from CORE and USOL markets in expandable rows with faction icons. Each merc card shows callsign, rank, status, specialization, traits, mission count, cost, rest timers, risk, failed-survive chance, and death chance. Elite mercenaries are displayed on top with a bold "ELITE" badge.
- **Auto Send Mercenary** — Enable "auto send" toggle and select a mercenary to send just after current expedition is done. It auto-claims previous reward container. Works across both CORE and USOL markets with market-aware expedition config.
- **Auto Choose Mercenary** — Enable "auto choose" toggle for extension to do best mercenary selection according to their cost and risk values across all markets.
- **Auto-choose USOL First** — When enabled, USOL mercenaries are prioritized over CORE mercenaries during auto-choose, picking the cheapest USOL merc before considering CORE.
- **Ignore Elite Mercenary** — When enabled, elite mercenaries are excluded from auto-choose selection.
- **Apply Merc Cost Limiter** — When enabled, mercenaries with costs above the configured "Maximum merc cost limit" are excluded from auto-choose selection. Default limit is 15,000.
- **Get rid of Veterans** — When enabled, overrides loot/risk modifiers for veteran mercenary expeditions with loot=1 and risk=10, making decisions favor high-risk options to have higher chance on getting rid of veteran mercs. Located in the Decisions section.
- **Auto Sell Cheapest Items** — Enable "auto sell" toggle for extension to sell two cheapest items from inventory automatically when there is not enough space to pickup expedition container items.
- **Inventory Batch Sell** — In the Inventory section, filter stash items by rarity (COMMON/RARE/EPIC) and craft tag (NONE/CRAFT), then sell all matching items in one action. Both filters must be chosen; a second confirmation click is required before selling.
- **Personal Drone Automation** — Fully automated drone missions (Personal Drone Assembling): auto-dispatch, auto-claim rewards, auto-resolve in-mission decisions, and custom repair rules (durability threshold, low-battery top-up, pause on repair failure, launch only when fully charged). Includes rate-limit retry with backoff that auto-disables on repeated failures. Active drone mission, its decisions, and archived drone missions are shown in the Expeditions panel, with the active mission pin-able like mercenary expeditions.
- **Archived Expeditions** — View past expeditions with outcome, cost, risk, location, loot container details and item images. Auto-loaded on startup
- **Multi-Alarm System** — Create multiple configurable alarms for any timer (daily ops, market job resets, expeditions). Each alarm has its own threshold, volume, continuous mode, and on/off toggle
- **Move Notifications** — Option to move in-game notification toasts and history panel from the right side to the left side of the screen
- **Secret Link/Server Finder** — Scans all known server IPs on the network map to discover hidden connections and servers. Sends `connect.ip` for each known IP, then compares before/after map data. Uses a toggle switch (auto-disables after scan) with progress and results shown in a log box. Reports new connections and new servers found
- **Helper-Only Mode** — Toggle to hide all automation features, converting the extension to a pure info/helper tool
- **Auto Update Markets** — Toggle to automatically refresh market data when WebSocket events arrive
- **Version Tracking** — Displays extension, web, system, and patch versions

- **Cache-First Design** — Data loads instantly from cache on popup open. Use the "Refresh All" button or per-section refresh buttons to fetch fresh data
- **Real-Time Updates** — WebSocket listeners auto-update daily ops, markets, expeditions, decisions, inventory, mercenaries, loadout, and archived expeditions live when data arrives — even if the popup is opened before data is ready
- **DevTools WS Inspector** — Built-in Chrome DevTools panel for real-time WebSocket message inspection and multicategory log viewer. Features include: category selector (WS Messages, Auto Job Solver, Auto Valuable Seller, Error Logs, Page Console Logs, Extension Console Logs), direction/event/action/server column filtering for WS messages, level/message columns for log categories, format dropdown (Raw / JSON-pretty / Interactive Tree View with inline object/array previews), search with highlight & navigation inside message detail (including tree view traversal with auto-expand), export filtered data as JSON or Markdown table, paginated log display (1000 entries per page) with section selector, IndexedDB-backed storage with 24-hour auto-cleanup, per-category clear, and resizable columns/detail pane.
